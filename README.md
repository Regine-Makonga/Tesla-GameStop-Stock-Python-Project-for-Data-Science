# Tesla-GameStop-Stock-Analysis
## Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard
In this Project we will use Webscraping to extract the revenue data for Tesla from 2010 to 2022 and GameStop from 2006 to 2020  and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue.
