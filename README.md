# Tesla-GameStop-Stock/Revenue-Analysis
## Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard
In this Project we will use yfinance and  Webscraping to extract the revenue data for Tesla from 2010 to 2022 and GameStop from 2006 to 2020. Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data.
