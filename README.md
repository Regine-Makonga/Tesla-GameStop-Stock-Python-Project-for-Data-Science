# Tesla-GameStop-Stock/Revenue-Analysis
## Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard
In this Project we will use yfinance and  Webscraping to extract the revenue data for Tesla from 2010 to 2022 and GameStop from 2006 to 2020  and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue. Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data.
